  <h1>How do I use this website?</h1>
  <p> On the main page, you'll see that the body has been divided into three regions: upper body (arms and chest), core (midsection) and lower body (legs). For each region, ONE bodyweight exercise has been chosen to develop the muscles there. </p>
  <p> Each exercise has been split into FIVE grades of difficulty. These are different variations of the base exercise that scale with increasing complexity. For optimal results, choose the hardest variation you can comfortably do with perfect form. </p>
  <h1>Why did you make this website?</h1>
  <p>With COVID-19 causing the collapse of civilisation as we know it, finding ways to destress is especially important. </p>
  <p>As all (ex-)gym goers know, exercise is a great way to do this. But what are we supposed to do now that gyms are closed?</p>
  <p>The reality is that exercising at home is the only option for most people. But not everyone owns a set of dumbbells or an exercise machine. And who can be bothered to do things like creating fake weights from milk jugs? </p>
  <p>Behold the solution: bodyweight exercises. Your body can be used in an infinite number of ways for strength training. All you need is yourself and the floor. No need to buy an expensive machine, lift water bottles or create broomstick barbells!</p>
  <p>Great, so we have our body and the floor. What are we supposed to do now? There's way too much information on the Internet - how do you even know where to start if you've never done a home workout? </p>
  <p>That's where this website hopes to make a difference :)</p>
  <p>In my opinion, the exercises listed here (pushup, plank and squat) are among the best bodyweight exercises you can do with zero equipment. They're also familiar to most people, whether you're a complete beginner or a seasoned gym rat. </p>
  <p>Another advantage of these exercises is that they can be endlessly modified. Whether you currently can't do a single push up or can do 500 in your sleep, I hope there's a variation on here that you'll find fun and challenging. </p>
