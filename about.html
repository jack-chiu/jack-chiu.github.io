  <h1>How do I view the exercises?</h1>
  <p>The diagram on the main page is divided into three regions: <span class="upperWord">Upper Body</span>, <span class="coreWord">Core</span> and <span class="lowerWord">Lower Body</span>.</p>
  <center><img src="body.png" width="200" height="400"></center>
  <p>For each region, <u>ONE</u> "base exercise" has been chosen to develop the muscles there.</p>
  <p>None of these exercises need any equipment. Do them anywhere you have space!</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Body Region</th>
      <th>Muscles Developed</th>
      <th>Base Exercise</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="upperWord">Upper Body</span></td>
      <td>Chest, Shoulder and Arms</td>
      <td>Push Up</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="coreWord">Core</span></td>
      <td>Abs, Back and Obliques</td>
      <td>Plank</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="lowerWord">Lower Body</span></td>
      <td>Quadriceps, Hamstrings and Calves</td>
      <td>Squat</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Each base exercise is split into <b>FIVE</b> grades of difficulty, i.e. variations of the base exercise.</p>
  <p>Number 1 is the easiest variation; number 5 is the hardest.</p>
  <p>When you return to the main page, click on the color-coded areas to view the relevant exercises.</p>

  <h1>How do I use the workout builder?</h1>
  <p>Once you've seen all the exercises, build a custom workout program for yourself.</p>
  <p>Pick <u>one</u> variation of each exercise by clicking on the dropdown boxes.</p>
  <p>Only pick variations that you can do with <u>perfect form</u>.</p>
  <p>Then, test yourself by seeing how many you can do. You could record yourself, or have somebody count aloud.</p>
  <p>The maximum reps you can do determines the appropriate sets and and rest periods for each exercise.</p>
