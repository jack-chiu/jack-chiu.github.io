  <h1>How do I view the exercises?</h1>
  <p> On the main page, you'll see that the body has been divided into three regions: upper body (arms and chest), core (midsection) and lower body (legs). For each region, ONE bodyweight exercise has been chosen to develop the muscles there. </p>
  <p> Each exercise has been split into FIVE grades of difficulty. These are different variations of the base exercise that scale with increasing complexity. For optimal results, choose the hardest variation you can comfortably do with perfect form. </p>
