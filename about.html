  <h1>How do I view the exercises?</h1>
  <p>On the main page, you'll see that the body has been divided into three regions: <span class="upperWord">Upper Body</span>, <span class="coreWord">Core</span> and <span class="lowerWord">Lower Body</span>.</p>
  <img src="body.png" width="50" height="100">
  <p>For each region, <b>ONE</b> bodyweight exercise has been chosen to develop the muscles there. </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Body Region</th>
      <th>Relevant Muscles</th>
      <th>Exercise Name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="upperWord">Upper Body</span></td>
      <td>Chest and Arms</td>
      <td>Push Up</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="coreWord">Core</span></td>
      <td>Abdominals and Obliques</td>
      <td>Plank</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="lowerWord">Lower Body</span></td>
      <td>Quadriceps, Hamstrings and Calves</td>
      <td>Squat</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Each exercise has been split into <b>FIVE</b> grades of difficulty. These are different variations of the base exercise that scale with increasing complexity.</p>
  <p>Number 1 is the easiest variation; number 5 is the most challenging.</p>
