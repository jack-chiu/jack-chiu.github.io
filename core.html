  <a class="center"><h2>1 - Knee Plank</h2>
  <img src="p1.gif" class="coreborder"></a>
  <p>This variation offers more support than a traditional plank by making it easier to balance. As a result, your core has to put in less work to keep your body straight.</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Retain a straight line from head to knee. Don't let your butt sag or point up too high!</li>
    <li>If possible, rest your knees on a soft surface like a yoga mat. </li>
    <li>This is a timed exercise that tests your endurance. To make it harder, do it for longer.</li>
  </ul>

  <a class="center"><h2>2 - Elbow Plank</h2>
  <img src="p2.gif" class="coreborder"></a>
  <p>This is the classic "plank" variation. Master the elbow plank, and you'll have a solid core to carry over into any physical activity!</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Retain a straight line from head to toe. Don't let your butt sag or point up too high!</li>
    <li>Tense your abs - a good way to picture this is if someone were about to punch you in the gut.</li>
    <li>This is a timed exercise that tests your endurance. To make it harder, do it for longer.</li>
  </ul>

  <a class="center"><h2>3 - Marching Planks</h2>
  <img src="p3.gif" class="coreborder"></a>
  <p>After a while, the normal plank gets boring. True to its name, marching planks spice up your planks by introducing some dynamic movement!</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Alternate raising legs to work both sides equally.</li>
    <li>Aside from the moving leg, every other part of your body should be completely stationary.</li>
    <li>Wait until the raised leg is firmly planted before you move the other one.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <a class="center"><h2>4 - Tuck Planks</h2>
  <img src="p4.gif" class="coreborder"></a>
  <p>Tuck planks require you to balance on one side of your body while squeezing your abs. Doing these with good form will require real coordination!</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Alternate bringing the elbow and knee on the same side of the body together.</li>
    <li>Focus more on retaining balance using one side of your body, and less on the dynamic movement of the other side.</li>
    <li>Wait until the arm and leg are firmly planted before moving the other side.</li>
  </ul>

  <a class="center"><h2>5 - LLPT (Long-Lever Posterior-Tilt) Plank</h2>
  <img src="p5.gif" class="coreborder"></a>
  <p>Imagine thinking: how do I make planks even harder? After holding this for 30 seconds, you'll wish normal planks were all you ever knew.</p>
  <p>For a scientific paper that talks about the LLPT (including a full technique breakdown), click <a class = "link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288093539_The_long-lever_posterior-tilt_plank" target="_blank">HERE</a> (opens in new tab).</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Unlike a traditional plank, your elbows are at eye level instead of your hands. This is the LL (long-lever) part of the LLPT plank.</li>
    <li>Once in this position, contract your glutes while bringing your pubic bone towards your belly. This is the PT (posterior-tilt) part of the LLPT plank.</li>
    <li>Enjoy :)</li>
