  <a class="center"><h2>1 - Chair Squat</h2>
  <img src="s1.gif" class="lowerborder"></a>
  <p>Since everyone's stuck at home during lockdown, you're probably a master of sitting down by now. Chair squats provide you with a nice safety net as you transition towards a bodyweight squat.</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>As you descend, send your butt back as far as possible. No one actually sits like this, but it's important for mimicking a proper squat.</li>
    <li>Keep your core engaged throughout the movement and contract your glutes as you stand up.</li>
  </ul>

  <a class="center"><h2>2 - Squat to Calf Raise</h2>
  <img src="s2.gif" class="lowerborder"></a>
  <p>You can't go wrong with a simple bodyweight squat: just drop your hips and then stand back up. Adding in a calf raise at the top will ensure that your legs are worked all the way through.</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use whatever feet position is comfortable for you - shoulder-width apart with slightly out-turned feet works best for most people.</li>
    <li>The descent should be like sitting into a tiny, imaginary stool.</li>
    <li>When you reach at the bottom, push through your heels to return to the top.</li>
    <li>At the top, press through your toes to perform a calf raise. Both the squat and the calf raise should count as one rep.</li>
  </ul>

  <a class="center"><h2>3 - Split Squat</h2>
  <img src="s3.gif" class="lowerborder"></a>
  <p>If the squat and lunge had a baby, the split squat would be the end result. The front leg will mainly use the quadriceps, while the back leg will mainly use the calf.</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Having your back foot go onto tiptoes lets you shift more weight forward.</li>
    <li>Put your hands on your hips or out to the sides for balance.</li>
    <li>Your back knee shouldn't touch the ground! Doing these on soft mat is useful in case you overshoot.</li>
  </ul>

  <a class="center"><h2>4 - Cossack Squat</h2>
  <img src="s4.gif" class="lowerborder"></a>
  <p>These are an adventurous alternative to the split squat for working your legs separately. Instead of forward-backward, you'll have to work on shifting your weight side-to-side.</p>
  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your feet should be placed considerably wider than shoulder-width.</li>
    <li>At the bottom, one foot should be flat while the other foot should be upturned from the heel.</li>
    <li>Only go as low as you feel comfortable, otherwise you might lose your balance!</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <a class="center"><h2>5 - Plyometric Tuck Squat</h2>
  <img src="s5.gif" class="lowerborder"></a>
  <p>Stand back - these are explosive. To do these, you'll have to jump every time you squat. To complete one rep, you'll also have to tuck your legs midair!</p>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The balls of your feet should be the last to leave the ground and the first to land.</li>
    <li>Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.</li>
    <li>As you jump, tuck your legs until your thighs are parallel with the ground.</li>
    <li>Soften your landings if possible - this will lessen the impact on your joints (and your downstairs neighbours).</li>
  </ul>
